# Tax Knowledge Prototype

This directory contains prototype authoring artifacts for an AI-assisted tax preparation backend.

The goal is to turn authoritative tax sources plus human tax expertise into versioned, reviewable, executable knowledge packages. Runtime services should consume only approved artifacts.

## Artifact Families

- `corpora/`: source corpus manifests and ingestion plans.
- `tools/`: deterministic ingestion utilities for agency source material.
- `schemas/`: YAML schemas for source, topic, question, evidence, conflict, rule, and scenario artifacts.
- `workflows/`: agent and human review workflows for producing artifacts.
- `sources/`: chunked source citations generated from authoritative documents.
- `relevance/`: chunk-level relevance classifications.
- `runtime-resources/`: maps from checked-in backend resources to source dependencies and generation targets.
- `topics/`: tax topic definitions and branch metadata.
- `rules/`: draft and approved tax rule models.
- `factgraph/`: source-backed fact graph work items and generated draft metadata.
- `questions/`: relevance-gated question definitions.
- `evidence/`: mappings from documents/imports to topic signals and candidate facts.
- `conflicts/`: contradiction and review-item rules.
- `scenarios/`: synthetic taxpayer fact bundles and expected outcomes.
- `reviews/`: human review packets and approval records.

## Runtime Boundary

These files are authoring artifacts. They should not directly change a tax return.

Backend services should compile approved artifacts into:

- topic applicability rules
- question planner inputs
- document evidence signal maps
- conflict detection rules
- fact graph rule drafts or generated fact graph XML
- PDF field-to-fact mapping drafts
- derived fact path indexes
- scenario regression tests

Only facts with explicit taxpayer confirmation or an approved system source should be written into the deterministic fact graph.

## Prototype Scope

The initial seed is federal tax year 2025 individual income tax, centered on Form 1040 and Schedule C/self-employment. The IRS corpus entry points are the official Forms, Instructions and Publications listing, the IRS static PDF directory, and the TY2025 Modernized e-File 1040 schema/business-rules page.

## IRS PDF Ingestion

Use `tools/download_irs_pdfs.py` to discover and optionally download IRS PDFs into a tax-year corpus:

```bash
python3 tax-knowledge/tools/download_irs_pdfs.py \
  --tax-year 2025 \
  --product-list tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/publication-products.txt \
  --carry-forward-product-list tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/publication-carryforward-products.txt \
  --output-dir tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/downloads \
  --manifest tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/pdf-manifest.json
```

The command above writes an inventory manifest only. Add `--download` to fetch PDFs and record SHA-256 hashes. Raw PDFs are ignored by git; the manifest is the reviewable handoff to source segmentation and artifact generation. The carry-forward list is for older IRS publications, such as Pub. 538, whose latest revision remains applicable until IRS updates, replaces, or obsoletes the product.

Some products require due-diligence handling rather than simple current-year filtering. See `tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/skipped-publications-review.yaml` for dispositions such as exact prior-year supplements (`p505--2025`, `p926--2025`) and discontinued publications (`p535`, `p536`) that require replacement sources.

After downloading PDFs, extract page text with the PDFBox utility:

```bash
cd utils/pdf-to-yaml
./mvnw exec:java \
  -Dexec.mainClass=gov.irs.directfile.pdftoyaml.PdfToSourceText \
  -Dexec.args="../../tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/downloads ../../tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/text"
```

Then segment the extracted page text into citation chunks:

```bash
python3 tax-knowledge/tools/segment_irs_sources.py \
  --tax-year 2025 \
  --manifest tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/pdf-manifest.json \
  --text-dir tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/text \
  --output-dir tax-knowledge/sources/irs/2025 \
  --require-downloaded \
  --require-text
```

The resulting source chunks are the citation layer used by agents and reviewers when drafting topics, rules, interview questions, evidence maps, and conflict rules.

Map backend runtime resources to source dependencies before drafting implementation artifacts:

```bash
less tax-knowledge/RUNTIME_RESOURCE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
```

The structured map is `tax-knowledge/runtime-resources/direct-file-resource-map.yaml`. It identifies which files under `backend/src/main/resources` and `df-plan-service/src/main/resources` are direct IRS-corpus generation targets, derived indexes, indirectly tax-dependent fixtures, or non-tax infrastructure.

Optional extraction sanity check:

```bash
python3 tax-knowledge/tools/compare_extractions.py \
  --primary-text-dir tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/text \
  --secondary-text-dir tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/vision-text \
  --output tax-knowledge/corpora/irs-2025/extraction-comparison.json
```

The secondary directory can be produced by a vision model or OCR engine as long as it uses the same `IRS_SOURCE_PAGE` page markers.

Classify source chunks by relevance:

```bash
python3 tax-knowledge/tools/classify_source_chunks.py \
  --tax-year 2025 \
  --sources-dir tax-knowledge/sources/irs/2025 \
  --rules tax-knowledge/relevance/federal/2025/classification-rules.yaml \
  --output tax-knowledge/relevance/federal/2025/source-relevance.yaml
```

Generate draft fact graph work items from rules plus classified source chunks:

```bash
python3 tax-knowledge/tools/generate_factgraph_work_items.py \
  --tax-year 2025 \
  --rules-dir tax-knowledge/rules/federal/2025 \
  --relevance tax-knowledge/relevance/federal/2025/source-relevance.yaml \
  --sources-dir tax-knowledge/sources/irs/2025 \
  --runtime-resource-map tax-knowledge/runtime-resources/direct-file-resource-map.yaml \
  --output tax-knowledge/factgraph/federal/2025/generated-factgraph-work-items.yaml
```

Before any artifact moves beyond draft, validate exact source provenance:

```bash
python3 tax-knowledge/tools/validate_artifact_provenance.py \
  --root tax-knowledge \
  --sources-dir tax-knowledge/sources/irs/2025
```
